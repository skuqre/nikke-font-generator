## Frame Allowance `Dec 1, 2023`

ladies and germs we are now able to prolong the video/gif

i intentionally did not include exporting to individual frames to be prolonged because i want that to be as "raw" as possible

the sole purpose of "individual frames" is to use such media for your editing shenanigans, but if you're against that idea, just holler at me at discord or smn

thank you!

## Motion `Nov 27, 2023`

it's time for some motion!

i pretty much overcomplicated the addition of this, so it's in the essence of "scripting"

it's pretty limited right now, but more to come if the people ask of it!

## Export `Nov 26, 2023`

- added the ability to download/export in 4 different types
    - Export as PNG...
    - Export as animated GIF...
    - Export as animated MP4...
    - Export as individual frames (as ZIP)...

[explanation page for each export type](/nikke-font-generator/what-is/export-types)

the site now uses tools like `Buffer`, `gif-encoder`, and `client-zip` for things like this. hope y'all enjoy.
