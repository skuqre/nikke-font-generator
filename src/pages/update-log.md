## Blabla Generator (BETA) `Dec 10, 2023`

**blabla generator!!**
- BETA phase, may have RIDICULOUS bugs
- sizing for it is currently disabled
    - *now that i think about it, it's small enough!*

**other changes**
- optimized some images

blabla generator! the next tool on the roster!
i find it odd how it turned out -- i myself thought it was going to be the skills screen.

either way, enjoy!

## Numbers `Dec 6, 2023`

- added Numbers to the logo generator
- added the ability to change seperate colors in the logo generator
- reduced file size of glyphs for the logo generator
- **BREAKING** default site behavior changed, outputs now change when you're typing, no more clicking "generate" when creating your images
    - button has been renamed to "Refresh" instead of "Generate"
    - old behavior can be toggled with by right clicking the button
- **BREAKING** behavior on Logo Generator changed
    - the big font's (one for the "NIKKE" text) way of being positioned vertically has been changed a bit:
    letters will now be centered vertically with the tallest letter in the word, there should be a small
    visual difference but everything would be fine.

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6lhGtIcWB.png" width="100%" />

just a temporary happy birthday Kevin

in all seriousness, this is a small little birthday thing for KennyP1, one of the people who first played with the Dialogue Generator! big thanks to you for using it avidly when it was in it's bones.

also: this is now a thing in the NIKKE Community server! there was a time where i would think to ask "i wonder how much would it take to get to #community-projects" but now it's in there since one of the big guys, Reed, noticed the site, and gave me the pass to post there!

don't worry about Anis's default btw, she'll comeback in ~12 hours after this update's release!

if you'd like to give a feature request or bug report, you can holler me there!

- fixed Color Bar not being the default color (`#f4d259` on Anis)

update 1: now changed to "Kenny"

## Frame Allowance `Dec 1, 2023`

ladies and germs we are now able to prolong the video/gif

i intentionally did not include exporting to individual frames to be prolonged because i want that to be as "raw" as possible

the sole purpose of "individual frames" is to use such media for your editing shenanigans, but if you're against that idea, just holler at me at discord or smn

thank you!

## Motion `Nov 27, 2023`

it's time for some motion!

i pretty much overcomplicated the addition of this, so it's in the essence of "scripting"

it's pretty limited right now, but more to come if the people ask of it!

## Export `Nov 26, 2023`

- added the ability to download/export in 4 different types
    - Export as PNG...

[explanation page for each export type](/nikke-font-generator/what-is/export-types)
