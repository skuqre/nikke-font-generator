## Some things

I hope to god that this site does not get used for misinformation *(hence the watermarks...)*.

The main inspiration of this site is the [GD Font Generator](https://gdcolon.com/gdfont) by GD Colon. <br>
I had the fonts on standby, so why not make some use out of them? It had to be done at some point.

I do other NIKKE-related projects too, but it's [Anis√©](https://github.com/skuqre/anise) for now.<br>
These projects are created by me for both you and me.

If you're wondering about usage guidelines, please head to [this point of the GitHub page](https://github.com/skuqre/nikke-font-generator#usage).<br>
Note that this is not **legal advise**, this is only my interpretation of what one should actually use the generators for.

<br>

Here's how much time it took for me to make this site:
| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Logo Generator** | About 6 hours for the base generator. About 2 more hours to get the UI up and running |
| **Dialogue Generator** | About a day to get the base generator done (includes research as well). About another day or two to get the UI up and running. The UI for it is more convoluted, so... |

For the sake of experience!

<br>

*Also; if you're wondering, my NIKKE username is indeed ANISNO1 -- I post on Reddit as ANISNO1 on NIKKE subreddits.*
