Type in anything in the text fields. Anything. Any word, any phrase, whatever.

That's it.

<h3 align="left">"NIKKE" text here...</h3>

This is where you type in the text in place of the "NIKKE" part of the logo.<br>
It's limited to a specific set of characters:
- A to Z (capital only, but its fine to type in lowercase!)
- 0 to 9
- `!`, `?`, `,`, `.`
- `$`, `\`, `/`, `?`, `:`
- `-`, `'`, `"`, `-`, `&`

<br>

<h3 align="left">"Goddess of Victory" text here...</h3>

This is where you type in the text in place of the "GODDESS OF VICTORY" part of the logo.<br>
It isn't limited to a specific set of characters and is only limited to how many the font Butch and Sundance provides you, so no need to worry about it too much.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Refresh button</h3>

If the logo either looks wrong and does not pertain to what you think it looks like, you can force it to redraw your logo by clicking this button.

<br>

<h3 align="left">100% selector</h3>

This is the overall size of your logo. It goes down only and can't go up due to the NIKKE part of the logo having a fixed resolution. You can change this if you think the logo is too big for your liking.

<br>

<h3 align="left">The upper color square</h3>

This is the color of the "NIKKE" part of the logo.

<br>

<h3 align="left">The lower color square</h3>

This is the color of the "GODDESS OF VICTORY" part of the logo.
