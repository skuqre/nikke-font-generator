# A dissatisfactory guide on how to use the Blabla Generator

---

<br>

As the Blabla Generator is as new as it is, it is getting more updates in the future. Expect this page to change A LOT.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Append</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX3OTCg8.png" />

This is the main part. The meaning of append is "to add" so I apologize for the weird word. Do note that the placeholder text will change depending on the context, but their purpose stays the same throughout the tool.

- **Character name...**: Character's name. There are some cases where a specific name may cause something else to show up when you press "Add Chat" (these are all case-insensitive):
    - Typing in **Commander** will make the message go the right (like the sender). This is only exclusive to the Commander as the commander has no name in his messages.<br>
    <img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX64Shzw.png" width="70%" />
    - Typing in **Indicator** will make the message appear as like one of those "END" indicators you see in the chat.<br>
    <img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX6asxER.png" width="70%" />
    - Typing in **System** will make the message appear as a system message. Things like "Anis joined the room." or "Anis has blocked you." can be put here.<br>
    <img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX6es98F.png" width="70%" />
- **What the character will be saying...**: Yeah.
- **Add Chat**: Adds the message to the chat. Like a "send" button.
- **These two buttons that always go unexplained**:<br>
    <img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX7Um7VJ.png" /><br>
    I will call these "Quick Switch buttons" as these buttons allow you to switch quickly between the previous chatter's name and the Commander, setting the right color as well. <br>The one that with the tail on the left will switch to the other chatters and the one with the tail on the right will switch to the Commander.
- **The color bar on the right**: Changes the message's bubble color.
- **Upload Character image...**: Allows you to upload a custom profile picture for the chatter you currently have.
- **Search for a character's image**: Saves you the hassle of looking up the character and cropping it properly if it's a character from NIKKE. Type in a NIKKE Character in here to look them up.<br>
    <img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX9u_RHR.gif" />
- **Send Image as character**: Allows you to "upload an image" and sends a message with the image only in it. You can make your NIKKEs send cat images to each other.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Edit</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nX9XuyoU.png" />

To edit an image, **you must change the "Index..." field first to select the image you'd like to edit**. You can change it to any number until you get to the message you want. This is how index is counted:

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXaoIBAP.png" width="50%" />

So if you put 0 in the index field, the corresponding fields will change to the image. When you change the corresponding fields, the message gets changed immediately.

- **Change Attachment**: Change/Add an image to the message. **Adding an attachment will make the message an attachment-only message, no text part included**.
- **The trash bin**: Remove image (if available).

<br>

<h3 align="left">Chat</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXbh5BUE.png" />

The chat part contains most of what to change in the chat interface. Such is the chat of the chat should chat will chat.

- **Chat Name**: The chat's name on the top orange part.
- **Scroll Offset**: The scroll offset position.
- **Drag: ON**: Toggles the ability to scroll up/scroll down with a mouse wheel or drag up/drag down with your mouse or finger.
- **Arrow: ON**: Toggles the arrow beside the Chat Name. This is for situations like a Blabla message in the middle of a dialogue interaction.
- **Time**: The time.
- **WI-FI Button**: Toggles the Wi-Fi symbol on the top-left.
- **Chats screen**: This button will switch the image to the "Chat List" where it contains the lists of chats. The corresponding fields will change their placeholder texts to the specific context. Also, some buttons will change as well.
- **Conversation screen**: This button will switch the image to the "Conversation" where it contains just your simple Blabla conversation. This is the default screen enabled.
- **Grid Background: OFF**: Toggles the grid background. *For whatever reason, the Grid Background disappears when you're fullscreen. In other screenshots, there is a faint grid background in there.*

<br>

<h3 align="left">Choices</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXe3hWTL.png" />

Same 'ol. 1 line is 1 choice. A message from the commander (with the default Commander Color) will show up always at the end of the conversation.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Thought</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXeBUzsM.png" />

When filled (and toggled to be shown), a thought bubble will be added to the screen. That's about it really. It darkens the screen and a thought bubble will show up.

- **The eye**: Toggles the visibility of the thought bubble. You can temporarily disable it if you'd like to keep something in mind while adding more messages.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Other</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXfpLpLh.png" />

- **Import JSON**: Lets you import a Blabla JSON file.
- **Export JSON**: Lets you export your current Blabla data to a JSON file. Includes images/attachments and custom profile pictures embedded in the JSON file.

<br>

<h3 align="left">Export</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXfTjkMt.png" />

You probably know what this does already... [see the full explanation for a more thorough description](/nikke-font-generator/what-is/export-types).

<br>

<h3 align="left">Delete / Reset</h3>

<img src="https://haxeflixel.is-terrible.com/6nXgfcUEj.png" />

This deletes/resets messages.

- **Delete last message...**: Deletes the latest (last) message.
- **Delete specific message...**: Deletes the message at the index provided on the field on the right.
- **Set Color to Commander's Color...**: Sets the current color to the color on the right.
- **The color bar on the right**: The **default** commander's color. This is the color of the choice bubble and thought bubble as well.
