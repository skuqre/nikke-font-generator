# Frame Allowance - Dialogue Generator

When exporting to video or gif, chances are the motion effects may be cut off due to dialogue ending early.

You can add a number to the field to prolong the video/gif when exporting. 30 frames means 1 second, so if you want to prolong it 2.5 seconds, you put 75 in there.


*this does NOT affect exporting to individual frames. this is a decision made by me but if majority wants it to affect it, shall it be then*
