# Export Types - Dialogue Generator

Ever since the update on `Nov 23, 2023`, 3 export types have been added so that you can make use of the generator more.

Here's what each one does, explained more elaborately by an idiot.

| Export type | What it does |
|-|-|
| **Export as PNG...** | downloads the output you currently see as an image file. it's the download button! |
| **Export as animated GIF...** | not necessarily animates the character if you uploaded the gif of the character, BUT, animates the dialogue text *(only, currently)*, as if it were typing itself, then it downloads as a gif. |
| **Export as individual frames (as ZIP)...** | imagine typing the same stuff one by one and exporting it one by one to create the typing effect. this one does it automatically and wraps it up in a present for you! |
