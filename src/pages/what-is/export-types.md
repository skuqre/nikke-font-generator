# Export Types - Dialogue Generator

Ever since the update on `Nov 23, 2023`, 4 export types have been added so that you can make use of the generator more.

Here's what each one does, explained more elaborately by an idiot.

| Export type | What it does |
|-|-|
| **Export as PNG...** | downloads the output you currently see as an image file. it's the download button! |
| **Export as animated GIF...** | not necessarily animates the character if you uploaded the gif of the character, BUT, animates the dialogue text *(only, currently)*, as if it were typing itself, then it downloads as a gif. **letters are typed every 75 milliseconds (0.075 seconds)** |
| **Export as animated MP4...** | like the previous one, but MP4 form. **letters are typed in a every 2 frames** |
| **Export as individual frames (as ZIP)...** | imagine typing the same stuff one by one and exporting it one by one to create the typing effect. this one does it automatically and wraps it up in a present for you! |

## Behavior warning
When clicking on one of them, your browser may lag for a bit; this is your device processing the images, so don't panic. 

The whole thing you're working with here is made to use YOUR device as no servers are involved in this site.

Exporting in MP4/GIF will provide you with a file that runs on 30 FPS at most. I'm excluding motion effects when exporting to individual frames as effects are fps based.
