# Export Types - Dialogue Generator

Ever since the update on `Nov 23, 2023`, 4 export types have been added so that you can make use of the generator more.

Here's what each one does, explained more elaborately by an idiot.

| Export type | What it does |
|-|-|
| **Export as PNG...** | downloads the output you currently see as an image file. it's the download button! |
| **Export as animated MP4...** | like the previous one, but MP4 form. **letters are typed every 2 frames**. |
| **Export as individual frames (as ZIP)...** | imagine typing the same stuff one by one and exporting it one by one to create the typing effect. this one does it automatically and wraps it up in a present for you! |

## Behavior warning
When clicking on one of them, your browser may lag for a bit; this is your device processing the images, so don't panic. **The title of the tab up top will show the export progress**. <span style="font-size: 14px; opacity: 0.5;">as much as i'd like it to be in the site itself, my dumbass can't find a way to do so.</span>

The whole thing you're working with here is made to use YOUR device as no servers are involved in this site.

Exporting in MP4/GIF will provide you with a file that runs on 30 FPS at most. I'm excluding motion effects when exporting to individual frames as effects are fps based.
