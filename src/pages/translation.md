# Translation Notice

---

<br>

As the site reaches different places, I've had a thought -- would it be awesome for everyone if the site had translations?

I recently saw the site at an `arca.live` (a Korean-oriented site) post containing some instructions on how to use it. It does do so... to an extent... but I've noticed how limiting this site is to other people who may have the least understanding of English.

The post tells you on how you can use the term `wo` to look for Ludmilla: Winter Owner's profile image, and `sw` for Snow White. That definitely stretches the ability of the fuzzy sort ability of the profile image lookup function, but could it be hard when looking for specific characters?

I'm thinking about internationalizing this site for easier access to everyone. What do you think?

## What's currently needed (to make it all work)

**The font Pretendard supports both Korean and English character glyphs**. Korean characters should be easily implemented (and works already to be frank).

**The Japanese font still hasn't been found**. I've tried my research, turning up to dead ends all the time. The nearest font I've gotten is [Visual Design Laboratory's LogoMaru font variant](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/vdl-logomaru) but that turned out to be genuinely inaccurate to the game's font.

I would have thought that the game uses an actual font file for Japanese, but I am only provided with the Japanese font's spritesheet. Can't really do much with it but hope and I'll find it someday.

The main game plan is to add the 2 main languages, Japanese and Korean, as translations. Other languages may be added when I think about it hard enough.

If you'd like to help with finding the Japanese font, you can let me know by messaging [`u/ANISNO1`](https://reddit.com/u/ANISNO1) for now. I only know like 2 ways to find the fonts and I'll try and brief you there.<br>
**Translation is currently an interest for now.**
