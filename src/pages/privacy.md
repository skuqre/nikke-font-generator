# Privacy

<br>

## I. What does the site get from me?

**Nothing**.

<br>

## II. What does the site use cookies for?

The site uses cookies to store a date string (e.g. `Aug 27, 2024`) that changes whenever there's a new major update. When the string gets replaced and is unequal to the new string, the update popup will be visible on your first visit. **You are free to clear these cookies whenever.**
