- Anything you create with these tools are **your own**, you're free to do anything you want with it.
- When creations from this tool are posted in official channels (e.g. Official Discord, Reddit, Facebook), **I am not liable for anything that happens to you**.
    - On the [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/nikke-en), creations that use images from NIKKE-DB are prohibited from being posted. *Use fanart for your creations if you'd like to post something with this to there instead*.
    - On the [Official Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile), the tool is widely used! Feel free to post your creations there, but don't do it too excessively!
        - Moreover, when posting creations from this site, please flair your post with **Fanfic** or **Meme**.
    - On various Facebook groups, it seems to be fine posting images created from this tool (however, I was told most posts were reposts). Feel free!
- When sharing your creations, **I recommend you keep the "NFG" watermark on to prevent people from being misinformed**. *Cropping it out is fine, I know the watermark's annoying, but I don't want the site to get taken down as well*.
    - When you post it, <u>credit is not mandatory, but very much appreciated</u>. **However, when someone asks you of how the image was made/"is this real?", inform them of this site**. *This goes for both watermarked/watermarkless posts.*
- You are **not** allowed to sell <u>ANYTHING</u> created from this site.
    - This encompasses every generator and future generators created after this statement has been added.
        - **Logo Generator** - the font for the "NIKKE" word mark is under personal use.
        - **Dialogue Generator** - contains assets made by SHIFT UP CORP. and Proxima Beta Ltd.
        - **Blabla Generator** - contains assets made by SHIFT UP CORP. and Proxima Beta Ltd.
        - **Boss Warning Generator** - contains assets made by SHIFT UP CORP. and Proxima Beta Ltd.
        - **Banner Generator** - contains assets made by SHIFT UP CORP. and Proxima Beta Ltd.
    - Various assets belong to SHIFT UP CORP. and Proxima Beta Ltd.
    - Only the **code** and **a number of assets** made by skuqre is under MIT License, which allows for commercial use.
    - You are however allowed to create physical objects (e.g. Acrylic keychains, Plastic cards, etc), but **NOT SELL THEM**!
- Some common sense as well, **credit the artist if you're using fanart for your creations**! *Not mandatory, but it'd be AWESOME if you did!!!*
