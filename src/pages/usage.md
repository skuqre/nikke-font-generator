# Usage

### Thank you for going here in the first place. Please read the contents carefully.

<br>

## Main

- Anything you create with these tools are **your own**, you're free to do anything you want with it.
- **The site does not obtain any <u>PERSONAL</u> information from you**. Anything you upload is not stored to any sort of server.
- When creations from this tool are posted in official channels (e.g. Official Discord, Reddit, Facebook), **I am not liable for anything that happens to you**.
    - On the [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/nikke-en), creations that use images from NIKKE-DB are prohibited from being posted. *Use fanart for your creations if you'd like to post something with this to there instead*.
    - On the [Official Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile), the tool is widely used! Feel free to post your creations there, but don't do it too excessively!
    - Ever seen something from this site that was posted on a Facebook page? Tell me and I'll put it here!
- When sharing your creations, **I recommend you keep the "NFG" watermark on to prevent people from being misinformed**. *Cropping it out is fine, I know the watermark's annoying, but I don't want the site to get taken down as well*.
- Some common sense as well, **credit the artist if you're using fanart for your creations**! *Not mandatory, but it'd be AWESOME if you did*.
