## Building
You know the drill.

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

The "meat" of the site is in `src\scripts`. `.astro` files are HTML files I *really* need to rewrite to be better. Styles are a mess.

## Usage

[Usage guidelines](https://skuqre.github.io/nikke-font-generator/usage/)

It's been moved to the site for ease-of-access.
