It's a barely accurate NIKKE Font generator!

No files are stored on me (there literally is no way to do that), images are generated with shitty JS code you can literally see on the page you're looking at when you're on the site.

Anything you create with the site is yours, do be told: all fonts are under **free for personal use**. Pretendard, I can't explain, because I got the font from Adobe Fonts which is a whole other dumpsterfire I can care less about.

Fonts used:
- Pretendard
- Docteur Atomic (cleaned up and is edited to resemble the current NIKKE logo)
- Butch and Sundance

Made with [Astro](astro.build).
